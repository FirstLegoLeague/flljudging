# FLL-Judging
The FLL Judging application is an application to make the judging during a tournament digital. It is a first step to move to a complete digital scoring and judging system for FLL tournaments. *Currently this branch is in a __development__ stage*.

#### Goal
The goal of the application is to support the judging process according the international FLL guidelines. This includes (but is not limited to) the following:
- Digital rubrics, with comments
- Ranking & nominations support
- Dissementation of rubrics (feedback) to teams
- Import and export of data (to and from judging lite or other applications)
For more information on the requirements refer to the [documentation](/description.md) file.

- Copy it onto your own servers, your client’s servers, your own computer, pretty much anywhere you want. There’s no limit to the number of copies you can make.
- Provide a download link on your website. Put the software on a bunch of thumb drives and give them away. Print out the source code and throw it from the rooftops (please don’t, though, because that would waste a lot of paper and make a mess). Charge a fee to distribute the software.
- If you want to charge someone to provide the software, set it up on their website or do anything else related to it, you can do so. But, you must give them a copy of the GNU GPL, which basically tells them that they could probably get the software elsewhere for free. Best to be up front about that, and about why you’re charging them.
- If you want to add or remove functionality, go ahead. If you want to use a portion of the code in another project, you can. The only catch is that the other project must also be released under the GPL. Ideally we would want you to share your improvements back with us on this GitHub.
- We welcome your feedback but please remember that this software comes with no guarantees.
